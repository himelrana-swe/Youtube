# Youtube Desktop Application

A cross platform **Youtube** Desktop Application.  Now available for Windows And Debian Installer package. Also available executable files for other Linux. 

# Why I have created this?

As an developer. Most of the time I must clear web browser. But I always like to listen some awesome music from Youtube during development. That's why created this solution. So that Youtube can be play from other application. Unfortunately **Spotify** Not available in my country. But this application is a very good alternative for listening all favourite music for free. I have implemented tray Icon functionality so that it's not take space in my Taskbar. That is also a great relief for me.

## Click on icon to download your version

Ohh. man i am updating this section. You are too early here. You can download from release section now.

## How to contribute.

I don't think this is an application that may have a lot of version. That's why I have not published source code.
I have developed this application using **ElectronJS**. If you think you have some great functionality that can make this application helpful to other people, And you know ElectronJS very well. You can contact with me.
I will share source with you. to upgrade this application. Also if you I think a lot of developer can contribute in this application I will update full source for public.
